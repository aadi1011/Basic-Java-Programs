# Assignment 5 Part 2
Take an abstract class develop two classes. The abstract class represents the basic building block for employees in a personnel database. 

Aim of this exercise:

- Generate concrete classes from an abstract class:  
  - Create abstract `employee.java`
- Write the code for a class `NormalEmployee` which extends the class above. This class should have a single method which calculates `monthlysalary()` salary for an employee. Compile the class. 
- Write the code for a class `BonusEmployee` which extends the class `employee.java`. This class describes an employee who has a monthly bonus added to their monthly salary. Compile the class.
- Create  a  fourth  file  which  tests  the  implementation  of `NormalEmployee` and `BonusEmployee` files by creating suitable objects.
