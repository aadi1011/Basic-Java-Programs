Implement the generic Shapes class as an interface `s` so that we can implement concrete classes like _circle, triangle, rectangle_ class from it.  
1. Write an abstract class Shape:
    * Protected Data members: `dim1`, `dim2`, `dim3`, `numSides` 
    * Constructor: initialize  `numSides`  and  dimensions,  zero  and parameterized constructors 
    * Concrete method: `getmethod()` for numSides 
    * Abstract methods: `getArea()`, `getPerimeter()`

2. Write a concrete subclass Rectangle
    * Protected Data members: dim1, dim2, 

3. Write a concrete subclass Triangle  
    * Protected Data members: dim1, dim2, 

4. Write a concrete subclass Circle  
    * Protected Data members: dim1, dim2, 

5. In another class, write a main method to define a Rectangle and a Triangle and Circle using concepts of Dynamic method Dispatch
